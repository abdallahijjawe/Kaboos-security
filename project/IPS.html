    <h1>What is KaboosIPS</h1>
    <p>KaboosIPS is the foremost Open Source Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) in the world. KaboosIPS IPS uses a series of 
        rules that help define malicious network activity and uses those rules to find packets that match against them 
        and generates alerts for users.
        <br><br><br>
        KaboosIPS can be deployed inline to stop these packets, as well. KaboosIPS has three primary uses: 
        As a packet sniffer like tcpdump, as a packet logger â€” which is useful for network traffic debugging, or 
        it can be used as a full-blown network intrusion prevention system. KaboosIPS can be downloaded and configured 
        for personal and business use alike.</p>
