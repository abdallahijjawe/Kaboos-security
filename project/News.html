            <p>A security breach at #Netflix's production partner, Iyuno, has led to the leak of unreleased episodes from several popular shows. 

                The breach, confirmed on August 9, 2024, resulted in unauthorized access to confidential content, 
                including clips, footage, and complete episodes, which were subsequently posted on platforms like Twitter,
                 4Chan, and torrent sites.
                
                The affected Netflix shows reportedly include: <br><br>
                
                - Arcane
                - Dandadan
                - Heartstopper
                - Jentry Chau vs. the Underworld
                - Mononoke the Movie: Phantom in the Rain
                - Plankton: The Movie
                - Ranma 1/2
                - Spellbound
                - Terminator Zero
                
                The anonymous leaker has also claimed to possess the first three episodes of the hotly-anticipated 
                season 5 of #StrangerThings, and has threatened to release them.</p>

                <p>The #CrowdStrike Outage Cost Delta Air Lines an Estimated $500 Million

                    Delta Air Lines experienced a significant operational disruption due to a CrowdStrike-caused outage 
                    on July 19, 2024, resulting in approximately 7,000 flight cancellations over five days. <br><br> 
                    
                    The outage led to an estimated $500 million in damages, prompting Delta to pursue legal claims against
                     CrowdStrike and Microsoft. <br><br>
                    
                    The financial impact includes a $380 million loss in revenue for the September quarter, primarily due 
                    to refunds and customer compensation. Additionally, the incident incurred $170 million in non-fuel 
                    expenses related to customer reimbursements and crew costs, while fuel expenses were reduced by $50 
                    million due to the flight cancellations.</p>

                <p>Israel - ZeroSeven Hacking Group Offers Full Network Access to Israeli Infrastructure: 80TB of 
                    Critical Data at Risk <br><br>

                    ZeroSeven, the same hacking group that recently leaked sensitive information from Toyota, is now 
                    selling full network access to servers containing 80TB of data related to Israeli infrastructure. <br><br>
                    
                    According to the post, this access allows entry to a large amount of sensitive data that could put 
                    Israel at significant risk, including:
                    - Detailed project information for water, oil, gas, power, and electricity across most areas of 
                    Israel and government sectors. <br><br>
                    - SCADA systems.
                    - Sensitive diagrams with specific coordinates for all projects, pipelines, and more.
                    - Complete databases (customer, financial, sensitive data, etc.).
                    
                    "We can do the same thing we did with Toyota and leak all the data, but instead, we are selling 
                    access to the servers so you can do whatever you want, whether it's ransomware attacks, causing 
                    damage, or stealing the data. We also offer to delete all data we have uploaded to our servers," 
                    the group wrote.
                    
                    It is still unknown whether this claim is true, but if it turns out to be legitimate and falls into 
                    the wrong hands, the potential severity of the impact would be critical.</p>
